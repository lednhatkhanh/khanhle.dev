I bought a .dev domain today and decided to start my blog! This is not something new since I have already been writing
my diary for a while now, but this is the first time I go for full English.

<!-- end -->

Google launched **.dev** domain a couple days ago and everyone in my team was so hyped about it, they started buying their own **.dev** domain and so did I. I got the **khanhle.dev** domain with the price of only 15\$ per year, and that it also comes with SSL! I couldn't describe how happy I am now since I get my own domain now. If you are also interested in the **.dev** domain, then head to [get.dev](https://get.dev) to check if your is still available.

So, the first thing that came to my mine was making my own blog. This is not new since I already have a simple Ghost site serves as my diary that I don't want to share with people, and it's written in Vietnamese. The new thing is, you guess, I will use English in this site and since I'm not a good writer even with my mother tongue not saying it's English this time, so if you spot any problems or I don't know what I'm writing then please, send me a message, yell at me about how bad I am and I will be very happy to take that. Seriously, I still have a long way to learn and improve every aspect of me, so any suggestion is gold to me!

This is my personal blog and I've should make a blog post introduce about me first but I'm so excited about owning the domain right now so this will be my first post!

I will share the new things I've learned, the error that I've faced, courses that I've taken, blog posts that I think really great, basically everything that I know and feel interesting while working as a developer. That also includes some stories too.

So, no matter who you are, a friend, a colleague, a stranger who just came by for a look then welcome!
